/**
 * The AnalyticsModelingErrorCode is definition of the first failure data capture (FFDC) for errors that occur when working with
 * the Analytics Modeling OMAS Services. It is used in conjunction with both Checked and Runtime (unchecked) exceptions.
 * <p>
 * The fields in the enum are defined in {@link org.odpi.openmetadata.frameworks.auditlog.messagesets.ExceptionMessageDefinition}.
 * The object is used to build exception augmented with parameters to identify related context:
 * <ul>
 * <li>HTTP Error Code - for translating between REST and JAVA - Typically the numbers used are:</li>
 * <li><ul>
 * <li>500 - internal error</li>
 * <li>400 - invalid parameters</li>
 * <li>404 - not found</li>
 * <li>409 - data conflict errors - eg item already defined</li>
 * </ul></li>
 * <li>Error Message Id - to uniquely identify the message</li>
 * <li>Error Message Text - includes placeholder to allow additional values to be captured</li>
 * <li>SystemAction - describes the result of the error</li>
 * <li>UserAction - describes how a AssetConsumerInterface should correct the error</li>
 * </ul>
